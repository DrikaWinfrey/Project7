I wrote this program to time the amount of time different sorting algorithms took to process an assigned array.

HeapSort performed faster than almost all of the other algorithms, with an O(n log n) time complexity, except JavaSort. Heapsort is generally considered an improved selection sort; it divides the array into an unsorted and sorted region, however unlike selection sort it does not scan the array linearly.
